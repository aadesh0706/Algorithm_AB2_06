# OSINT Dark Web Threat Intelligence Platform 🔍💻  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project is an **OSINT-based cybersecurity tool** designed to monitor and analyze dark web activities for leaked credentials, cyberattack discussions, and other threats. By scraping hacker forums, breach databases, and underground marketplaces, the platform provides **real-time alerts** and a **threat intelligence dashboard** to help security teams take proactive measures.  

## 🛠 Features  
✔ **Dark Web Crawling & Data Collection** – Scrapes breach forums and data leaks (Pastebin, TOR-based sites).  
✔ **AI-Powered Threat Intelligence** – Uses **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to detect sensitive information like emails, passwords, and financial data.  
✔ **Real-Time Threat Alerts** – Notifies users when leaked credentials or security threats are detected.  
✔ **Risk Assessment & Prioritization** – Assigns a **risk score** to detected threats.  
✔ **Dark Web Search (Optional)** – Allows users to check if their credentials are exposed.  
✔ **Threat Dashboard** – Displays active leaks, exposed data, and risk levels in an interactive UI.
